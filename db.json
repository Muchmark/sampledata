After you’ve done your research, created a business plan, and are ready to move ahead, you need to get to the nitty-gritty and file the paperwork to ensure that you set up your new business correctly. While paperwork, taxes, and legalities may not seem as enthralling as the other aspects of your business it is vital to get those in order to start off the right foot and protect yourself and your upcoming business in the long term.  To make things easier, we have compiled some initial info and recommendations about those first steps, including links to tax forms and legal documents . Before you select a business name, make sure it’s not taken. Most states have online databases to help with that. Visit your Secretary of State to inquire if your business name is free and how you need to register it. Also, check with the US Patent and Trademark Office to ensure your name is not trademarked or in use in another state. Once you choose a name, you’ll want to protect it.  Even if you don’t set up a website at first, reserve your name and register your site. Check the name availability at a domain registrar and reserve it.  Also, you may want to trademark your name depending on your business"

While most SMBs view digital consumer transactions as a given, billions of dollars of business-to-business, or B2B, payments are still issued with paper checks. With the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, small businesses recognize the need to diversify their payment methods and find solutions that facilitate “hands-free” B2B payments to keep the wheels of business turning. ACH payments or ACH transfers are electronic bank-to-bank money transfers processed through the Automated Clearing House Network. ACH payments allow entities to securely send and receive electronic payments even if they are at different banks. Types of ACH  transfers include person-to-person payments (like Venmo), business bill payments, direct deposits from employers to employees, and government benefit programs. Signing up to send or receive ACH payments requires both sides to connect their bank to the ACH network and give permission to deduct or credit their account. For this reason, many small businesses are still hesitant to adopt ACH as a form of payment to their vendors. However, checks and ACH use the same financial information to process payments (routing number, account number, and payment number). Any time a small business sends a paper check, the data on it can potentially be exposed to whoever comes in contact with it. On the other hand, the ACH network has security protocols set up to allow businesses to join the network and transfer money between them without seeing each other’s bank details and protecting data."
